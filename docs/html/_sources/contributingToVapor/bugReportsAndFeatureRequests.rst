Bug Reports and Feature Requests
________________________________

To submit a new bug report or feature request, you can click the "New issue" button in the upper right of our `GitHub issue tracker <https://github.com/ncar/vapor/issues>`_, or by `clicking on this link <https://github.com/NCAR/VAPOR/issues/new/choose>`_.

Bug reports are an important part of making Vapor more stable.  A bug report should have a brief description of the problem, as well as a list of steps to reproduce the problem.  See `this stackoverflow article <https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve>`_ for tips on writing a good bug report.

If you're building Vapor from its source code and find a bug, always try to reproduce your bug on the *main* branch.  

It is also worth searching for existing bug reports and pull requests to see if the issue has already been reported and/or fixed.  It's possible that a bug may be fixed, but it has not been merged into *main* or incorporated into a current installer.
